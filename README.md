This is my repo for scripts and notes for internship searching. I am looking for internship opportunity as part of my degree program. I found some sites that advertise opportunity on the country that I reside right now, Scotland.

Aside from those sites I also look for unadvertised positions by contacting companies directly through their careers/recruitment emails. Usually they have a career page that showing openings in their companies.

I learned about ScotlandIS and their technology award and looking at their awards they seem to give them to interesting companies, so I think I will try to ask them if they have internship opportunity at their place.

As I have just learned about beautiful soup I would like to employ this new tool to test my understanding, just a simple one. In ScotlandISParsing.py I parse the award page and extract the shortlisted companies [link](http://www.scotlandis.com/digitaltech2017/digitaltech2017-shortlist/). After having the lists I then google each of the company to read about their vision, mission, and projects manually and see if they are interesting and apply if it is.
